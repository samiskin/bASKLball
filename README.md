# Scala-LWJGL

This is an Activator template for quickly starting a new project that uses
LWJGL 3.0.0 and Scala. This project seed should start you off with the bare
minimum of what you'd need to develop a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)
LWJGL application in Scala.

Please note that while this is, theoretically, an Activator Template, you can
also use SBT to compile and run the project. Both build tools will provide the
same results.

Included is an example of how one might go about converting functions into
various "Callbacks" for more streamlined integration.

The build will try to detect the current OS and setup the library path and
"-XstartOnFirstThread" automatically. If this doesn't work automatically for
you, please let me know.

Have fun.
